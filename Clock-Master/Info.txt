if you want to use this for your own Arduino project just
save the parent folder called "Clock-Master" as a zip folder
and then add a zip library folder in your Arduino IDE

Help:
Open the Arduino IDE
Go to sketches
click on "Add .zip library"
navigate to the Clock-Master zip folder and add it

(I wrote this Code years ago so it is not the best.
It may be updated in the future)

this can be used for a small watering system
